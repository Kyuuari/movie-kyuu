              <AccordionContent>
                For me this was just a small project to play around with, I
                considered the option of adding login and signup functionality
                for users to save and store their favorite movies to a cloud
                based storage. However, for now I decided to go with local
                storage instead, main reason was I just want users to have fun
                with the app without the hassle of signing up for a small app
                like this and losing their data if I decide to use the database
                for another project
