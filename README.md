# MovieKyuu
MovieKyuu is just a small website I built for finding and sharing movies that interest you.

NO SIGNUP REQUIRED all movies added to list are saved locally to device.

## Introduction
This project utilizes NextJS 13 app directory and React Server Components to fetch data from TMBD and serve up performant server generated pages, with a mix of interactive client components.


This was a small project created to help further my understanding of the web and modern frameworks, being used today. Under the hood this project uses:

* Next
* TMBD API
* shadcn/ui
* Tailwind

**Status**: Work in Progress 





## Roadmap

- Include TV Series

- More Search Options
